# Fixed Issues Summary - May 16, 2025

## 1. Enhanced Skills Radar Chart (`js/enhanced-skills-radar.js`)

### Fixed Issues:
1. **Event Handler Memory Leaks**
   - Properly storing event handlers for legend items in `_boundEventListeners` object
   - Correctly storing event handlers for control buttons with unique keys
   - Updated `destroy()` method to properly remove all event listeners using stored references

2. **Modal Event Handler Cleanup**
   - Added event listener cleanup to prevent memory leaks when modal is closed
   - Ensuring event handlers are properly removed before removing elements from DOM

3. **Missing Method Implementations**
   - Implemented `resizeCanvas()` method with proper DPI handling for high-resolution displays
   - Implemented `redrawChart()` method for rendering the radar chart
   - Implemented `startAnimation()` method with smooth animations using requestAnimationFrame
   - Added animation easing function for better visual feedback
   - Fixed visibility change handler to properly resume animations

4. **Added Helper Methods**
   - Created a helper file (`js/enhanced-skills-radar-helpers.js`) with drawing methods:
     - `_drawLevels()` for background level circles
     - `_drawAxes()` for axis lines
     - `_drawAreas()` for colored category areas
     - `_drawDataPoints()` for data point vertices
     - `_drawAxisLabels()` for axis text labels
   - Implemented proper prototype-based method addition
   - Added script initialization pattern to ensure methods are available regardless of script loading order
   - Added script import in index.html, ensuring proper ordering

5. **Script Loading and Initialization**
   - Added timeout to DOM content loaded handler to ensure helper methods are properly loaded
   - Added system logging for successful initialization
   - Implemented helper script with robust checks for SkillsRadarChart class availability

## 2. Modal Styles (`css/modals.css`)

### Fixed Issues:
1. **CSS Compatibility**
   - Removed nested CSS selectors using the `&` syntax for better browser compatibility
   - Organized styles with more explicit selectors
   - Added comments for better clarity and maintainability

2. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Added `backface-visibility: hidden` to animated elements for better performance
   - Added vendor prefixes for broader browser compatibility

3. **Animation Cleanup**
   - Verified keyframe animations are properly defined
   - Added performance optimizations to animation-heavy elements

## 3. Navigation Styles (`css/navbar.css`)

### Fixed Issues:
1. **Animation Performance**
   - Added `will-change: opacity, transform` to animated elements
   - Added `backface-visibility: hidden` for GPU acceleration
   - Optimized transitions by specifying exact properties to animate rather than using `all`

## 4. Hero Section Animations (`css/enhanced-hero.css`)

### Fixed Issues:
1. **Performance-Heavy Animations**
   - Added `will-change` property to elements with animations
   - Added `backface-visibility: hidden` for better rendering performance
   - Added vendor prefixes for cross-browser compatibility

## 5. Project List Animations (`css/enhanced-projects.css`)

### Fixed Issues:
1. **Pulsing Animation Performance**
   - Added performance optimizations to pulsing dot animations
   - Specified exact properties that will change during animation
   - Added hardware acceleration hints

## 6. Overall Performance Improvements

1. **Script Loading Optimization**
   - Ensured proper script loading order in index.html
   - Added defensive code to handle cases where scripts load in unexpected order

2. **Animation Performance**
   - Added appropriate performance hints across multiple animation-heavy CSS files
   - Implemented GPU acceleration for key animations

3. **Memory Management**
   - Fixed memory leaks by properly cleaning up event handlers
   - Added proper cleanup for animation frames in all components

### Fixed Issues:
1. **CSS Compatibility Issues**
   - Removed nested CSS selectors using the `&` syntax for better browser compatibility
   - Moved the nested focus selector to a separate CSS rule

2. **Animation Performance Optimization**
   - Added `backface-visibility: hidden` to animated elements for better performance
   - Optimized animated content with hardware acceleration hints

## 3. Navbar Styles (`css/navbar.css`)

### Fixed Issues:
1. **Animation Performance**
   - Added `will-change` property to animated elements for rendering optimizations
   - Added `backface-visibility: hidden` for better GPU acceleration

## General Improvements
- Enhanced performance of animations across all components
- Improved cleanup of event handlers to prevent memory leaks
- Better High-DPI display support
- Optimized performance for mobile devices

## Future Recommendations
1. Add comprehensive error handling to all methods
2. Implement proper testing for the components
3. Consider adding touch gesture support for better mobile interaction
4. Optimize animation performance further with selective rendering

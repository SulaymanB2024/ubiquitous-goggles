   - Particles.js might not be properly initializing
   - The interaction between particles-config.js and the DOM may be failing
   - Missing mouse event handling for particle interactivity
   - Possible script loading order issues

3. **Component Integration Issues**
   - EventBus may not be properly connecting all components
   - Cross-component communication between Skills Radar and Network Visualization
   - Event propagation or subscription issues

4. **Performance Optimization Needs**
   - Animation effects may be causing performance degradation
   - Particle system needs further optimization
   - Mobile responsiveness issues

# JavaScript Component Fixes

## 1. Enhanced Skills Radar Chart Fixes

### Issues Fixed in `/js/enhanced-skills-radar-helpers.js`

1. **Fixed Duplicate Functions**:
   - Removed duplicate `_drawDataPoints` function from the helper file since it was already implemented as `_drawEnhancedDataPoints` in the main radar class
   - This removes redundancy and prevents potential conflicts

2. **Fixed Angle Calculation in `_drawPulsingGlow` function**:
   - Corrected angle calculation in the glow effect position calculation
   - Aligned the helper method with the main class implementation to ensure consistent rendering

3. **Fixed Data Structure Handling**:
   - Updated the `_drawPulsingGlow` function to properly handle the data structure with categories and skills
   - Fixed iteration over skills within category objects

4. **Code Organization**:
   - Improved structure of the helper methods
   - Made sure initialization is properly handled

5. **Version Updates**:
   - Updated version from 1.2.0 to 1.3.0 in the helper file
   - Updated version from 1.1.0 to 1.2.0 in the main file

### Issues Fixed in `/js/enhanced-contact-terminal.js`

1. **Added SystemLog Integration**:
   - Added integration with the global SystemLog in key functions:
     - `processCommand()` - Logs user commands to the system log
     - `executeCommand()` - Logs command execution
     - `submitForm()` - Logs form submission start
     - `finalizeFormSubmission()` - Logs successful form submission

2. **Integration Benefits**:
   - Improved monitoring and debugging capabilities
   - Better cross-component communication
   - Consistent logging across the application

## Testing

The fixes have been tested to ensure:

1. The skills radar chart renders correctly
2. The pulsing glow effect appears in the proper position
3. The contact terminal properly logs events to the SystemLog when available
4. No JavaScript errors occur during normal operation

## Next Steps

To further improve these components:

1. Consider implementing error boundaries around the radar chart initialization
2. Add performance monitoring for the radar chart animations
3. Create more comprehensive event tracking for user interactions
4. Consider adding more thorough JSDoc comments for better documentation
